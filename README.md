The examined geographical area is in Seattle metropolitan area

My web map also has the available zoom levels of each tile set, it is on my map's bottom right corner

For the brief description of each tile set.
Base map, This map illustrates the golden age of the Seattle. Golden color looks great on Seattle for a base map because Seattle looks much more beautiful with the sun.
Hospital locations in Seattle. This map illustrates the locations of hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area. I used light mapbox style to make it more obvious for hospital locations in red dots to be shown on there.
Hospital locations in Seattle shown on base map. Nothing details in depth about this map, since it is just the overlapping of the base map and the hspital locations in Seattle, but it looks more obvious with those dots on the base map, it makes the users much easier to find where the dots are located.
LGBTQ Themed map, This map applies the colors of the LGBTQ flag, so it contains purple, yellow, pink, red, etc to represent the color of LGBTQ rainbow flag, the sea is shown in yellow color instead of dark blue, the land is shown in red color, and the names of locations are shown in purple color, the forest is shown in yellow color. It is a great representation.
